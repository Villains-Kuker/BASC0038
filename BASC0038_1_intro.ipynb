Even though a problem such as binary search is elegant to describe and understand recursively, it is also possible to define and implement iteratively, instead.

This follows on from a principle known as Turing completeness, which addresses the fundamental nature of problems being solvable.\n",

By avoiding recursion, we can instead keep all of the work contained on one level of the stack.\n",

Instead of recurring on half of the array, either `min` is set to the element above the middle, or `max` is set to the element below the middle. The algorithm still terminates when we reach an array of size 0, so we loop until `min` becomes greater than `max`, which means we no longer have a valid array."

        "Why is this useful? In the former, note that we use `len` to easily obtain the length of the list. In low-level languages like C, a list is represented only by the memory address of the first element &ndash; there is absolutely no other information available! Therefore, your two options are to maintain and pass a separate length variable around with the list, or to use a sentinel value marking the end of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages of the former are that it is cumbersome to maintain and pass around a size with the list at all times (but it is also useful information to have). A major disadvantage of the latter is the *semipredicate problem*, in which the sentinel value must be distinct from any valid values in the list. In the example above, we have assumed that `None` is not a valid value to appear in the list, but this is merely context-dependent. This is why in the general case in something like C, passing a size variable is more standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most well-known example of the sentinel approach in something like C is in a string, which is simply a list of characters (try this in Python by indexing and slicing a string just like a list). Each character is a 1-byte ASCII value. In ASCII, the value 0 represents a null character, so C-style strings have the ability to terminate with 0 as a sentinel, as opposed to an explicit size. This is known as a *null-terminated string*. As a higher-level language, Python strings are objects which contain accessible size data just like its lists etc.\n",

Even if it is allowable to append a value to the list, it assumes that there is extra memory readily available to do so, which may not be the case in the low-level environment we would need to be in to be considering this optimisation in the first place. An alternative to this issue might be to temporarily *replace* the last value with the sentinel and explictly check the last value outside of the loop. Clearly, this is an esoteric optimisation in a rarely-encountered situation, but principles like this are interesting nonetheless and might transfer to different situations in surprising ways."

        "A reason that selection sort might outperform insertion sort is the fact that both perform $O(n^2)$ comparisons, but the former only performs $O(n)$ swaps compared to insertion sort's $O(n^2)$. This is especially understandable in the worst case, where the number of comparisons between each is equal, but contrasts with the fact that insertion sort performs half as many comparisons in the average case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why, then, is insertion sort the gold standard of the quadratic sorts? The confusing factor in this instance is that we are using Python, a high-level, interpreted language which is generally slow compared to low-level, compiled languages such as C, C++ etc. In this environment, the greater number of memory writes (swaps) for insertion sort is expensive enough to make selection sort more efficient in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if you tried implementing these exact same algorithms elsewhere (especially in compiled languages) you should find insertion sort outperforms on average. This is due to the fact that memory writing will be less disproportionately expensive, so insertion sort's halved number of comparisons on average will make it more efficient. In fact, you should find it will take *less than half* time on average, to the point where it will outperform *even in the worst case*. This might seem odd, considering that both algorithms perform exactly the same number of comparisons in the worst case, with insertion sort performing more swaps. The most likely reason for this is cache efficiency, that is, insertion sort only ever compares and swaps elements which are directly next to each other in the array and thus memory, whereas selection sort must repeatedly scan through the entire array over and over (see *locality of reference*).\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, insertion sort is generally cited as the most efficient quadratic sorting algorithm. Future worksheets will cover a variety of more sophisticated sorting algorithms that achieve better than quadratic-time complexity, but insertion sort will remain highly relevant as its sheer simplicity gives it a lack of overhead (in addition to its optimal best-case complexity) in real implementations, so it generally outperforms even more sophisticated algorithms on smaller lists."

        "This worksheet has focused on insertion sort as the most important quadratic-time sorting algorithm and selection sort as its main competitor. However, there are actually many different approaches falling under the category of quadratic sorts. Take a look through this (non-exhuastive) list and try implementing some or all of them for yourself:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   ***Bubble sort***: The most famous alternative. One pass of bubble sort compares each element, starting from the first, to its next, swapping them if the first is larger than the second. Passes are simply performed repeatedly until no swaps were performed on a pass, upon which the algorithm terminates. It is so named as each pass causes larger elements to 'bubble' upwards to the top &ndash; in fact, the next-largest element ends up in its correct position each pass. It is commonly cited as a terrible algorithm, due to the fact is generally performs many, many swaps (although, like insertion sort, it is actually optimal in the best case).\n",
        "*   ***Cocktail shaker sort***: Bubble sort exhibits *rabbits*, larger elements which move to the top quickly, and *turtles*, smaller elements which move to the bottom slowly. Cocktail shaker sort is a minor variation which passes upwards and downwards alternatingly to help speed up turtles... providing a correspondingly minor improvement.\n",
        "*   ***Comb sort***: Another variation of bubble sort. Usually, elements being compared have a gap of 1, i.e. neighbouring elements are compared each pass. In comb sort, the gap is initialised to some value much larger than 1, such that elements far apart are compared and swapped. On the next pass, the gap shrinks by some factor $k$, such that elements somewhat closer together are now compared and swapped. This continues until the gap shrinks down to 1, which thus degenerates back to regular bubble sort until the list is sorted. This tackles the issue of turtles more effectively than cocktail shaker sort, providing a more efficient algorithm than both it and bubble sort.\n",
        "*   ***Shellsort***: An efficient variation of insertion sort. Just how comb sort applies a decreasing gap size to bubble sort, shellsort applies a decreasing gap size to insertion sort. In other words, insertion sort is first performed on the sub-list of elements separated by some gap. That gap is then reduced by some factor $k$; this is repeated until a final regular pass of insertion sort is performed, i.e. with a gap of 1. This is efficient because insertion sort performs exceptionally well on nearly-ordered lists &ndash; each iteration of shellsort takes the entire list closer to an ordered state, making each insertion sort increasingly efficient. Complexity analysis is non-trivial and, to begin with, depends on the value of $k$, but can improve insertion sort's $O(n^2)$ time, e.g. to $O(n^\\frac{3}{2})$ and $O(n^\\frac{4}{3})$.\n",
        "*   ***Bogosort***: Repeatedly randomise the order of the list until it just happens to be ordered correctly. The worst-case complexity is *unbounded*. For the naysayers, it is also optimal in the best case.\n",
        "*   ***Quantum bogosort***: Randomise the order of the list and if it not ordered correctly then destroy the universe. Assuming the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics holds, one universe will remain wherein the order is correct. Alternatively, destroy yourself, to similarly ensure a subjective experience of surviving with the ordered list (see *quantum immortality*).\n"
